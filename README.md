# Multi-Socket Node Graph Types

If you've ever used Blender's [Geometry Nodes](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/index.html), it has an amazing implementation that respects the types of a Geometry
Nodes' Sockets when attempting to connect nodes. This library is a starting point for implementing something similar in
TypeScript.

## Future Plans

Better Examples:
- Integrate With @xyflow types
  - connect node sockets
  - drag and drop nodes over an edge, automatically connecting sockets
